# Machine-Learning
This is my first Machine Learning Program. This program differentiates whether if given dataset falls in the category of Apple or Oranges.
I used scikit-learn which is an open source library. This program falls in the category of Supervised Learning which would create a classifier by finding patterns in example.
You are going to have ti install Anaconda or Canopy which would give you access you to multiple Python Packages for science,math,engineering and data analysis.
The way supervised learning works is by collecting training data which in this program would be the features(Weight, texture) and labels and using the features and labels to train the classifier using a Decision Tree classifier and after training the classifier we provide an example dataset by which the program makes prediction if the example data set is an Apple or an Orange.

To run this program you are going to have to go the terminal and browse to the location where you saved the python script and run the program in terminal.
